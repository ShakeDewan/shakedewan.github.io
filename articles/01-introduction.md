# The True Bottleneck: Why AI Fails in the Enterprise

*The hardest part of enterprise AI isn't finding the right model—it's identifying the correct business constraint to apply it to.*

When I started at Deloitte building out the NLP Center of Excellence, a recurring pattern emerged: technological pilots were successful, but production deployments stalled. Everyone wanted a chatbot, a document summarizer, or a predictive model because the technology was undeniably cool. But the conversation was almost exclusively about architecture and model parameters, rather than operational reality.

Why? Because companies treat AI as a silver bullet instead of a lever. 

### Systems Thinking in the Age of LLMs

I approach AI implementation through the lens of **systems thinking** and **process optimization**. If you deploy an incredible, state-of-the-art LLM to optimize a process that is *not* your business's primary bottleneck, your overall throughput will not change. You have simply made a non-critical step faster, causing work to pile up at the actual constraint.

The reality of scaling these systems inside an enterprise is far messier than a compelling demo. It involves:
- **Identifying the True Bottleneck**: Where is value actually getting stuck? 
- **Change Management**: How do human operators interact with the output?
- **Measurable ROI**: Can we directly tie this deployment to a reduction in operating costs or an increase in top-line revenue?

When these factors are ignored, you end up with sophisticated toys rather than production-grade assets. 

### Moving from Service Provider to Problem Solver

This is exactly why I founded AI Forward and why I take on Fractional Chief AI Officer roles. I don't just "build apps." I bridge the gap between deep technical engineering and the executive C-suite. We start by forensically identifying your high-ROI business problem—the constraint holding back your growth. Only then do we bring in the right technical stack—whether that's fine-tuning an open-source model, implementing a scalable RAG pipeline, or simply orchestrating existing APIs.

Over time, this mindset shift has driven over $10M in new contract value and resulted in systems that run reliably for dozens of clients. 

### What's Next

The models will commoditize. The strategic application of them won't. If you are building AI features just because your competitors are, you're already behind. Start with the problem, measure the ROI, and *then* execute with technical precision.

I am currently distilling these frameworks and my experiences into a **book on the future of business in the context of AI**. This space will serve as a testing ground for those ideas, diving deep into production-grade applications, team scaling, and strategy. Stay tuned.
