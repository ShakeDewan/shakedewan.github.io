Most leaders know AI matters. They just don't know where to start or what will actually move the needle. I translate the tech into clear business outcomes.

Former Deloitte AI lead (scaled team to 20+, cut delivery time 50%, $10M+ in contracts). Now CEO of 𝗔𝗜 𝗙𝗼𝗿𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗱 and fractional CAIO for startups and mid-market companies.

❖ 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗜 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗽
• Find the AI opportunities that actually improve your bottom line
• Build solutions that work in the real world, not just demos
• Scale your team's AI capability without the guesswork
• Make sure the tech serves the business, not the other way around

❖ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜'𝘃𝗲 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁
• Scaled Deloitte's NLP Center of Excellence to 20+ practitioners in 18 months, contributing $10M+ in new contracts
• Architected data platform that powered Forbes 30 Under 30 fintech startup to $10M+ ARR
• Built flagship deployment accelerator that cut project delivery time 50% across multiple engagements
• Led 30+ enterprise AI engagements as CEO of AI Forward, managing team of 5 practitioners
• Product endorsed by Google's Director of Research, Peter Norvig

I care about solving problems, not selling buzzwords. Let's talk:

🚀 Just wrapped up an incredible week at Startup Fest Montreal!

As a judge, I had the privilege of evaluating dozens of innovative startups. What struck me most wasn't just the creativity, but the recurring patterns I noticed in business model challenges:

📊 The Top 3 Gaps I Observed: 
• Revenue models that don't scale with customer acquisition costs 
• Market size assumptions without proper validation 
• Go-to-market strategies that ignore competitive positioning

The energy from founders was infectious - their passion reminded me why I love this ecosystem. But the real magic happened in those 1-on-1 conversations where we could dive deep into strategy.

💡 Key takeaway: Even the most brilliant ideas need rock-solid business fundamentals. It's not about having a perfect pitch - it's about having a sustainable path to growth.

Huge shoutout to the Startup Fest team for creating such an incredible platform for founders to connect, learn, and grow. The Montreal startup scene is absolutely thriving! 🇨🇦

Already counting down to next year. Who else will I see there?

What's the biggest business model mistake you've seen startups make? Drop your thoughts below! 👇

Was a pleasure being invited as a judge to provide feedback to some budding startups and founders. More to come.

Last week, Startup Ecosystem Canada partnered with The Product Folks to host a small, high-signal "Product Teardown: Growth, AI & SaaS" roundtable in Toronto.

We brought together experienced product and growth leaders with founders from the Toronto Business Development Centre (TBDC) cohort for constructive feedback and real product conversations.

Big thanks to the PM and growth experts from companies including Hootsuite, PostGrid, and Thoughtworks who shared candid perspectives and actionable input.

If you missed this one, join us for the next "Pitch Teardown" Toronto event happening next week co-hosted with The Product Folks (Tues, Feb 24th) : https://luma.com/p8eodcoo
